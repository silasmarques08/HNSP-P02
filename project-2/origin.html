                <h1 class="fs-2 fw-bold ">WHERE WE COME FROM</h1>
                <p>Our burger house was founded in 2018 by Agni Pontevedra, a passionate burger
                    enthusiast who had a dream of bringing delicious and satisfying burgers to our community. From the
                    beginning, we have
                    been committed to using only the freshest ingredients and highest quality meat to craft our burgers.
                </p>
                <p> As we grew, we became known for our unique blend of spices that give our burgers a flavor that is
                    second to none. Our secret recipe has been passed down through generations, and we take pride in
                    making each burger with the same care and attention to detail that we did when we first opened our
                    doors.</p>
                <p>Today, my<strong>BURGR</strong> continues to play a beloved part in the community, with customers
                    returning again and again for the delicious burgers that have become our trademark. We are proud to
                    continue our founder's legacy and share our passion for great burgers with everyone who visits our
                    restaurant.
                </p><br>
                <h1 class="fs-2 fw-bold ">THE SOURCE OF OUR EXCELLENCE</h1>
                <p> At my<strong>BURGR</strong>, we know that great burgers start with great ingredients. That's
                    why we are committed to carefully selecting only the freshest, highest-quality ingredients for all
                    of our menu items. We use only 100% beef in our burgers, and we work closely with our suppliers to
                    ensure that our meat is sourced from cattle that are raised humanely and sustainably.</p>

                <p>We also use fresh produce in all of our toppings and sides, and we take care to source our
                    ingredients locally whenever possible to support our community and reduce our environmental
                    footprint. Our buns are baked fresh daily, and we never use preservatives or artificial flavors in
                    any of our menu items.</p>

                <p>We believe that every bite of our burgers should be a delicious and satisfying experience, and that
                    starts with the quality of our ingredients. When you dine with us, you can trust that you're getting
                    the best burger experience possible.
                </p>
